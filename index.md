## Do you like to rant?

Well I do. This is **ranting rabbit**, a project to show other people how easy it is
to open a small webpage (thank you [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) and
[Jekyll](https://www.jekyllrb.com/) and actually do what other people are alway
talking about.

Nothing stops you from opening a blog nowadays. It is not hard.

## What this is

The main reason of ranting rabbit is of course: rants.

Rants about people, about politics, about technical stuff and many other things.
Especially rants about stupid things.
Everything that annoys me during my day to day life.

And I also try to make the world a better place. If you do not like my suggetions,
please rant about them.

## What this is not

Nobody shall be denounced or personally attacked.
All the changes you do and all the rants you write are linked to your user account.


The whole thing is quite transparent since GitHub (and the underlying git) attributes
all actions to useraccounts and logs all the changes of all files. You can see which user
account created the rant and, if it was edited, you can see by whom and why. If you which
to create a rant yourself, you can create an (unverified) user account in 20 seconds, create
a rant and send a pull request via GitHub.
